    <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Throughout the process of developing this website, there were quite a few 'ups' and 'downs' so to speak. This is to be expected of any development process, which personally i have had my fair share of (albeit not as much as a full time developer).
      The most difficult part of the process was coming up with the intial design and functionality description, there are so many possiblities when it comes to a new design that i took a while to narrow them down. Most notably, to the ones that were
      simple and modern. Something i came to realise not long after building my initial design is that I tend to overcomplciate things when they are alternate, simpler routes to take. Case in point, responsive content sections, the final solution that
      I used was more of a hybrid of serveral versions, it worked but definitely could have been alot better. The biggest issue was that the sections were flexible but their wrappers were blocks, causing alignment issues with resizing to window width.
    </p>
    <p>Another key issue was efficient functionlity implementation (JavaScript), it is quite easy to fall into the trap of load heavy JS due to its dynamic nature, however, with the inclusion of packages such as jQuery, it simplifies this process
      greatly and leaves you with an assurance of efficiency. Pure DOM element manipulation can cause quite the number of issues, even if they may not be immediately obvious, sometimes notorious for being browser picky.
    </p>
    <p>Leading into the content and other material, creating interesting content that is succinct but packed with meaning is quite difficult and at times felt like not enough time was spent on it (one of the many pitfalls of being engulfed in a development).
      Although, there are sections which definitely could do with revision, overall there wasnt too much in the way of content lacking areas. Primarily due to the abundance of documentation surrounding quantum mechanics and computing, this resulting in
      the opposite occuring, trying to compact a large amount of information into a very small space.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, the development for this website was pretty straight forward compared to others i've worked on in the past. However, I wont' gloss over the fact that it needed better planning, which would have made alot of the tasks much easier considering
      that there were numerous times when I had no plan and just went with whatever popped into my head. Bad idea, i know. Intially, i had an approach layed out to ensure that i could give adequate attention to each section, but as small amounts of over
      attention to sections compounded, I found that there was less attention paid to areas such as content and structure.
    </p>
    <p>Looking back at the development of this website, it was a fairly uneventful proccess compared to most I have done. Most likely due to the fact that we could work on a topic that interested us (Cheers Tom), so solving any problems didn't feel as if it
      was an impedance, rather a challenge.
